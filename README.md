# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in Python to predict whether bank customers are likely to close their accounts based on specific features.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for banks. Using machine learning techniques, this project aims to predict the likelihood of churn based on features like demographics, account details, and activity history. The ANN model achieves this by analyzing a structured dataset of bank customer information.

## Features
- **Input Features**: The dataset includes various features, such as customer demographics, account details, and transaction history.  
- **Target Variable**: A binary indicator specifying whether a customer has closed their account (1: Yes, 0: No).

## Repository Contents
- **`churn_prediction.ipynb`**: The Python script implementing the ANN model.  
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for this project includes customer data.  
  > **Note**: The dataset is not included in this repository due to confidentiality concerns.

## Results
The script provides the following outputs:
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays the accuracy, loss curves, and other key metrics to evaluate the model's performance.  
- **Feature Importance Matrix**: Outputs a detailed matrix showcasing the features and their contributions to the predictions, allowing for deeper insights into customer behavior.
